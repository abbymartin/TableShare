A simple website that decreases space inefficiency and increase sense of community amongst students by allowing students to consolidate easily.

## Setup
Click on the website. Navigate to a specific area using the toggle button. If you are looking to see if the seats in a table are open, each table is indicated with color green or red based on its availability, along with a specific note. If you claim an empty table, you can either mark it as available or unavailable, based on your preference. Before you leave, make sure you mark the table as available!
